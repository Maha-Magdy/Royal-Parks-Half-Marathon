                        <p>Nicknamed “The Beast,” Yohan Blake is one of the famous runners to not miss out on every list
                            of fastest runners. In fact, he is arguably believed to occupy the second position of the
                            list of fastest runners in the world as he was able to complete a 100-meter sprint in 9.69

                        <p>Before Usain Bolt came forward to hijack the title of the fastest runner globally, Asafa
                            Powell, a Jamaican-born, was holding the title. Seeing him on the list, one is not surprised
                            going by the fact that he has won four world champions 100 meters gold medal and several
                            other medals.</p>

                        <p>Justin would have been the world’s first fastest man when he completed a 100m sprint in 9.45
                            seconds to break Usain Bolt’s record. But he was denied the title because he was believed to
                            have been assisted by massive wind turbines.</p>
